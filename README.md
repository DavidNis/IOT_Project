Project description:
An open-source smart remote solution designed to modernize how air conditioners are controlled. This project leverages an ESP32 microcontroller, IR transmitter, IR receiver, and sensors to provide seamless integration with a custom-built Flutter application. Users can remotely control their AC, monitor environmental conditions, and automate operations, enhancing comfort and energy efficiency.

Smart AC Hardware:
- DHT Sensor: Monitors and measures the current room temperature to provide precise control.
- Radar Sensor: Detects motion within its range to enable automated responses, such as turning the AC off when no motion is detected.
- IR Transmitter and Receiver: Controls the AC via infrared signals and can replicate remote commands.
